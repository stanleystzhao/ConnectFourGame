# Connect Four

Connect Four is a game in which the players choose a color and then take turns dropping colored tokens into a six-row, seven-column vertically suspended grid. 
The pieces fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space within the column. 
The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own tokens.
